# Globus at the Smithsonian

**All Smithsonian staff can log into Globus right now at [app.globus.org](https://app.globus.org) using their network credentials — no registration, VPN, or special setup required.**

## What is Globus?

Globus is a secure, high-performance data transfer platform that enables Smithsonian staff to move large datasets between storage systems and share data with external collaborators. Transfers happen server-to-server, so you can start a transfer and close your laptop.

**Smithsonian infrastructure includes:**

| Location | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Smithsonian Data Center | Hydra (HPC), DAMS NAS, unit network drives |
| STRI | Tropical research data workflows |
| SAO | Astrophysical research data |
